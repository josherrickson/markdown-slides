Text can be simply entered. Markdown enables simple text styling, such as **bold**, *italic*, `code`, or [links](https://ihpi.umich.edu/member-resources/data-and-methods).

We can also include:

- lists
- tables

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| a | 1 |
| b | 2 |

Code chunks can be included easily:

```{r}
x <- 100
z <- rnorm(x)
hist(z)
```
