Example 1
====================
- Discuss
  - Header
  - Text, markdown
  - lists, tables
- Discuss R code chunk
- Knit
- Show pdf, word
  - pdf: Looks like latex, some things look slightly different (table)
  - Discuss pros/cons
  - html - pro: fastest to build, doesn't require anything to share
         - con: not modifiable
  - pdf - pro: most precise (html can look different per screen),
        - con: slow, not modifiable, requires LaTeX set up on computer
  - word - pro: modifiable
         - con: Word
- Change header - add author
- Show that code is persistent (add mean(z) in new chunk)
  - Forces organization - chunks must be in proper order
- As notebook, demostrate chunks inline


Example 2
====================
- Discuss
  - options (echo, figure size)
- Add global options briefly
- Continue discuss
  - table of contents, sections
  - inline code
  - Making output look better
  - Can include equations as well (First is LaTeX style, second is Markdown)
- Switch to pdf
- Can produce manuscript-style doc easily
- Switch to word
  - **** Remove toc options ****
  - **** 2nd table, html to markdown ****
  - Doesn't recognize pure LaTeX, does support markdown
  - image is fuzzy, add dpi = 300

Example 3
====================
Embedding Stata, SAS
1) ssh greatlakes
2) cd ~/repos/markdown-notes/examples
2) module load R stata-se sas
3) R -> rmarkdown::render("example3.Rmd")
4) Locally; scp greatlakes:~/repos/markdown-slides/examples/example3.html ~/Desktop/.; open ~/Desktop/example3.html


Example 4
====================
Anna Kratz
 - Goal is interplay of negative symptoms of MS (pain, fatigue, depression, cognition)
 - Walk through code - Different sections, inclusion of Stata.
 - Discussion is more readable to non-R experts than just code, or code and comments.
   - Can look nicer through use of lists, etc.
 - Build file, should work!
 - R version info at bottom for reproducibility

Example 5
====================
Bookdown!
- Bookdown is a "flavor"
- Can split into multiple files
- https://github.com/m-clark/mixed-models-with-R, https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/
  - All in R

Example 6
====================
Slides!
- https://github.com/josherrickson/markdown-slides
- Looks like regular markdown; code and chunks in sections
- Header specifies that its slides

Example 7
====================
Stata
- Markdown same, stata chunks different
- Graphs are slightly more complicated.
- example7.do to dyndoc file, open in html
- output is very basic, unlike RMarkdown, no "flavors"
  - Instead, manual configuration. header.txt, css, provided by Stata

Example 8
====================
stats-notes
- Stata Markdown -> Markdown -> Rmarkdown -> output
- https://errickson.net/stats-notes/randomselection.html
  - Done by adding some "wrong" tags, so Stata ignores
  - Show fixRmd.R that cleans up the "wrong" tags
    - Now markdown file contains only markdown, no chunks
      - All code is just inside code markdown


Example 9
====================
margins-notes
- By including sub-pages which are either Rmarkdown or Dyndoc, can appear that both are working simultaneously
- Using another flavor; flex dashboard
