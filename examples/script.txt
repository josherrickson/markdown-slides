Example 1
====================
- Discuss
  - Header
  - Text, markdown
  - lists, tables
- Discuss R code chunk
- Knit
- Show pdf, word
  - Discuss pros/cons
  - html - pro: fastest to build, doesn't require anything special to share
         - con: not modifiable
  - pdf - pro: most precise (html can look different per browser or screen size),
        - con: slow, not modifiable, requires LaTeX set up on computer
  - word - pro: modifiable
         - con: Word
- Change header - add author
- Show that code is persistent (add mean(z) in new chunk)
- As notebook, demostrate chunks inline


Example 2
====================
- Discuss
  - options (echo, figure size)
- Add global options briefly
- Continue discuss
  - inline code
  - Making output look better
  - Can include equations as well (First is LaTeX style, second is Markdown)
- Switch to pdf
- Can produce manuscript-style doc easily
- Switch to word
  - Doesn't recognize pure LaTeX, does support markdown
  - image is fuzzy, add dpi = 300

Example 3
====================
Embedding Stata, SAS

Example 4
====================
Anna Kratz
 - Goal is interplay of negative symptoms of MS (pain, fatigue, depression, cognition)
 - Walk through code - Different sections, inclusion of Stata.
 - Discussion is more readable to non-R experts than just code, or code and comments.
   - Can look nicer through use of lists, etc.
 - Build file, should work!

Example 5
====================
Bookdown!
- Bookdown is a "flavor"
- Can split into multiple files
- https://github.com/m-clark/mixed-models-with-R, https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/
  - All in R
- https://github.com/josherrickson/stata1, https://errickson.net/stata1/index.html
  - Dyndoc -> Rmarkdown -> html (https://github.com/josherrickson/dyndoc_via_rmarkdown)

Example 6
====================
Slides!
- https://github.com/josherrickson/matching-slides, https://errickson.net/matching-slides/index.html#/
- Looks like regular markdown; code and chunks in sections
- Header specifies that its slides

Example 7
====================
Stata
Markdown same, stata chunks different
