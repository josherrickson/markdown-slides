We can run other languages embedded inside R, simply by calling the appropriate "engine".

Here's Python:

```{python}
import random
print random.randint(1,100)
y = 500
```

```{python}
print random.randint(y, y + 10)
```

Python is a first-class citizen, Python chunks operate just like R chunks.

We can also include Stata.

```{stata}
sysuse auto
regress weight i.foreign
```

Unfortunately, Stata is a second-class citizen here - *each Stata chunk runs independently*.

```{stata}
regress weight i.foreign
```

SAS can similarly be called, but again is a second-class citizen and each chunk runs independently.

```{sas}
data weight; 
   input IDnumber $ Week1 Week16;
   WeightLoss=Week1-Week16;
   datalines;
2477 195  163
2431 220  198
2456 173  155
2412 135  116
;            

proc print data=weight;
run; 
```

There are some workarounds to this (e.g. the "SASmarkdown" package) that I haven't looked into too much. For Stata, I'd rather just write Stata dyndoc commands, then pass the results through RMarkdown.
